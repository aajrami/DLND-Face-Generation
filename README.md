# Face images generation using GAN
### The fifth project for the [_**Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation**_](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101)

In this project we built a model using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate new image faces. The [_**CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)**_](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) was used to train the model.

The project was implemented in Python and using Numby and Tensorflow.

#### Topics covered are:

- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Deep Convolutional GANs
- TensorFlow
